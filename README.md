# TeamChooser-Ionic

<p>This project is an <b>AngularJs app</b> which attempts to create fair teams from a set of players.</p>
<p>Along with its back end support, this mobile app attempts to increase the quality of sports games by decreasing the difference in skillset between two teams.</p>
<p>Machine Learning is used to infer the ratings of players and correctly assign them to teams, resulting in scores being close together(e.g 1-1, 2-1, 3-3)</p>
